<!--
    Thank you for taking your time to report a bug in Overstrike.
    Please read the following carefully before creating the issue.

    Before reporting a bug, please make sure that:
    - it is a bug indeed, and not a user mistake;
    - there is no commonly known solution (described in README.txt or discussed
      by other users in comments, Discord, Reddit, etc);
    - that bug is not already reported by someone else.

    If it's a bug in someone else's tool, or in the game itself, it could be
    that there's nothing that can be done from Overstrike side. Such bugs still
    could be reported to see if some kind of workaround could be implemented in
    Overstrike to prevent or mitigate the bug.

    In the report, please add as much technical details as possible, because
    it could be that the bug only reproduces under specific circumstances only.

    --
    [!] Issues that don't follow the guidelines described above would be deleted.
        Please be more informative than "fix", "dont werkz", etc.

    [!] This isn't a free tech support line.
        If you have a problem that isn't a bug, ask for help somewhere else.

    [!] There's no need to spam with issues or "bump" them.
        It could take a while to fix a bug.
    --

    In your report, please clearly describe what the bug is
    and what you expected to happen instead.

    Provide steps to reproduce it. If you can't pinpoint those, just describe
    what were your actions before the bug occurred.

    If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

    If bug happens during mods installation, see if any useful information
    is in 'errors.log' file, and post an excerpt from it.

    Some of the technical details that could be useful:
    - Overstrike version;
    - game version;
    - your platform (operating system & specs).

    Don't include this text (between < and >) in your report.
